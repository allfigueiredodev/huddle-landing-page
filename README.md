## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git
- Github

### What I learned

This was my first project using SASS, I tried to use a little bit of everything that I learned.

```css
@mixin before  ($url, $margin: 0) {
  content: url($url);
  display: inline-block;
  width: 25px;
  height: 25px;
  margin-right: $margin;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to develop more projects using SASS to get more familiar with it.
